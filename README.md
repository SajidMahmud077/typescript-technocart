TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, offering enhanced tooling and scalability for large applications. It adds syntax for types, enabling developers to define the types of data being used, which helps catch errors early through compile-time type checking. TypeScript code is ultimately transpiled into JavaScript
Key features of TypeScript include:
Static Typing: Allows explicit type annotations, improving code readability and maintainability.
Interfaces: Enables the definition of contracts for object structures.
Classes: Provides support for object-oriented programming paradigms.
Enums: Allows the declaration of named constants.
Generics: Facilitates the creation of reusable components that can work with multiple types.
Modules: Supports code organization and modularity.
